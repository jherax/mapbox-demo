# GraphQL and React Map GL

This project was bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Environment

This application depends on some environment variables. Once you have cloned the
repository
[https://github.com/jherax/mapbox-demo](https://github.com/jherax/mapbox-demo),
go to the root directory and create a `.env` file with the following keys:

### Server

```properties
EXPRESS_PORT=9000

# dev | prod | qa
NODE_ENV=dev
```

### Client

```properties
# Graphql resource location
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=https://fxjney46mbeijjyti3ysri6afi.appsync-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/graphql

# Authorization Header
REACT_APP_AUTH_TOKEN=___Authorization_Key___
REACT_APP_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=___React_Mapbox_Access_Token___
```

Whitout those values, the app can't start properly.

## Running the server

Just run the command

```bash
npm install
npm run dev:server
```

## Apollo GraphQL

The path that resolves Apollo queries is: `/graphql`.

ðŸ’¡ When running in non-production environment, the `/graphql` and `/sandbox`
paths are enabled to run an
[Apollo Sandbox](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/explorer/sandbox/)
environment where we can now execute GraphQL our queries on our own server.

- Default path: [localhost:9000/sandbox](http://localhost:9000/graphql)
- Online Sandbox:
  [studio.apollographql.com/sandbox](https://studio.apollographql.com/sandbox/)

## VS Code REST

This App suggest installing some VS Code extensions to ease the development
experience. One of those extensions is the
[REST Client](https://github.com/Huachao/vscode-restclient#making-graphql-request)
which allows you to send HTTP request and view the response in Visual Studio
Code directly. This extension comes with a build-in support for making GraphQL
requests.

You can find the file containing the graphql queries here:

- [getCities.http](backend/graphql/__tests__/getCities.http)
- [getCitiesByName.http](backend/graphql/__tests__/getCitiesByName.http)
- [getCitiesByCountry.http](backend/graphql/__tests__/getCitiesByCountry.http)
- [getCitiesByLanguage.http](backend/graphql/__tests__/getCitiesByLanguage.http)
- [getRegionConfig.http](src/views/Rentalscape/services/__tests__/getRegionConfig.http)
- [getRegionNames.http](src/views/Rentalscape/services/__tests__/getRegionNames.http)
- [getProperties.http](src/views/Rentalscape/services/__tests__/getProperties.http)

## Applications

The Express backend is started by running `npm run dev:server`. The server is
listening by default in [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000). You can
change the default port by setting the key `EXPRESS_PORT` in the `.env` file.

The following paths are part of the Express router:

- [`http://localhost:9000/graphql`](http://localhost:9000/graphql): GraphQL
  server.
- [`http://localhost:9000/sandbox`](http://localhost:9000/sandbox): GraphQL
  sandbox.

The front-end application is started by running `npm run start`, then the
browser opens [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with the default
view.

The following paths are part of the React router:

- [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000): Mapbox demo (default view)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev:server`

Runs the Express server running at
[http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000).

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests)
for more information.

### `npm run test:be`

Start the test suite for the code in the `/backend` directory.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best
performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about
[deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for
more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can
`eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from
your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive
dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have
full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but
they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point
youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for
small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this
feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t
customize it when you are ready for it.
